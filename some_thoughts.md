The main goal was to create a REST API service which simply provides the service of making appointments to doctors.
The biggest part of my time took the logic of limitations of times of appointments and setting types of time properly to set everything to work.
I've just implemented the system with the help of which you can make appointments on any day of the week, if the doctor is available of course.
The one thing i left is to make a refactoring as Service Object pattern, because i left everything inside of controller which is bad practice, but i have no time unfortunately.
